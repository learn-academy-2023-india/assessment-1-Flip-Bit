# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:  Git is whats known as a distributed version control system.  It lets multiple devs work together on a single project in a streamlined manner.

Github is an online UI that uses git

Researched answer:  I covered it well I believe


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?


Your answer:
- Index = number representation for the position of an element in an array
- Value = The data itself, or what is saved within a container for an index in an array

Researched answer:
- Index:

An index is a numerical representation that indicates the position of an element in an array.

It is a zero-based integer that starts at 0 for the first element in the array.

Each element in the array has a unique index, and you can access an element using its index.

- Value:

The value is the actual data or content stored at a specific index in an array.

It represents the information that the array element holds.

The value can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, objects, or other arrays.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:
- Similarites = Ordered Collections, iterations, indexed elements
- Differences = Arrays are mutable, can be changed
                Strings are immutable

Researched answer:

Mutable vs. Immutable:

Arrays are mutable, meaning you can change their elements by assigning new values or modifying existing ones.
Strings, in many programming languages including JavaScript, are immutable, meaning you cannot change the characters once the string is created. Instead, you create a new string.
Data Types:

Arrays can hold elements of different data types (e.g., numbers, strings, objects).
Strings typically represent sequences of characters and are composed of characters of a single data type.
Methods:

Arrays have built-in methods specifically designed for manipulating arrays, such as push, pop, splice, and more.

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?
- Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism

Researched answer:
Encapsulation:

Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class.
Purpose: It helps in hiding the internal state and requiring all interactions to occur through an object's methods. Encapsulation protects the integrity of the internal data and prevents unintended external interference.
Abstraction:

Definition: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should have.
Purpose: It allows developers to focus on the necessary features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. Abstraction provides a clear and concise representation of the essential aspects of an object.
Inheritance:

Definition: Inheritance is a mechanism by which a class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The class that is inherited from is called the base class or parent class, and the class that inherits is called the derived class or child class.
Purpose: It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes. The child class can reuse the methods and attributes of the parent class and extend or override them as needed.
Polymorphism:

Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects and allows objects to be used interchangeably.
Purpose: It simplifies code and increases flexibility. Polymorphism is often expressed through method overloading and method overriding. Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, while method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
These four pillars provide a foundation for organizing and designing code in a way that promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability. They are fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming and are widely used in languages like Java, C++, Python, and others.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher-order Functions: A function that takes multiple other functions as arguments or returns a function as the result

2. Jest: A JS testing library/framework.  It was created by Meta(Facebook)

3. Objects: A data type that is composed of data as well as the functions(methods) that will work within the object
